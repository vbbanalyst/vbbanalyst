### 👋 Hi there, I'm Valeryia.
#### 👩‍💻 Data Analyst from Belarus.

After graduating from law school, I became a business lawyer, because I wanted to be part of business development. At the same time, I have always been interested in the causes and consequences of various processes, people's behavior.

I took courses for lawyers in IT, where I got to know this area better. I realized that here I can combine all my interests together.

After looking at professions in IT, I saw myself in data analytics and decided to change my profession.

At the moment, I am finishing the "Data Analyst" courses at Yandex.Practicum. I have learned the basics of analytics and statistics, Python, SQL and visualization of analysis results.

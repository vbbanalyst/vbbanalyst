### Hi there, I'm Valeryia.
## Begginer Data Analyst from Belarus.

I devoted 10 years of my life to law: 2 years of exam preparation, 4 years of university studies and 4 years of practice in various organizations. However, the current situation does not allow me to develop successfully as a lawyer.

I decided to move from text analysis to analysis of numbers and other data.

At the moment, I am finishing the "Data Analyst" courses at Yandex.Practicum. I have learned the basics of analytics and statistics, Python, SQL and visualization of analysis results.
